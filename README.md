# Input and output in C without using any libraries.

This project demonstrates the implementation of system calls for Linux in C.

* Implementation of the `_start`. The _start function serves as the entry point for the program. It performs initial operations such as reading data and processing it. 

* Implementation of the `sys_read`. The next step is to create the sys_read system call. It reads data from standard input (STDIN).

* Implementation of the `sys_write`. The sys_write system call allows data to be written to standard output (STDOUT).

* Implementation of the `sys_exit_group`. This system call is used to terminate the program with a specific exit code.
